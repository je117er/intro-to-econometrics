### START OF QUESTION B ###
# Run a regression of Growth on TradeShare, YearsSchool, Rev_Coups,
# Assassinations, and RGDP60. 
model = lm(growth ~ tradeshare + yearsschool + rev_coups
           + assasinations + rgdp60, data=data)

summary(model)

# What is the value of the coefficient on Rev_Coups? 
rev_coups_coeff = model$coefficients["rev_coups"]
rev_coups_coeff # -2.157503

# Meaning of this coeff: For each additional revolution/coup, the growth 
# will decrease by 2.157503%. Since this is greater than the average growth rate,
# a country expericening conflict will have negative growth rate. On the other
# hand, it's difficult to gauge whether the value is large/small irl, since it 
# depends on the growth rate of the country without revolution + how large/long 
# the revolution is.
